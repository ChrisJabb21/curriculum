Sometimes there is data you want to analyze which is not on your spreadsheet.

It could be anything, employee records, demographics, income record, etc.

Adding it all by typing can take significant time. 

This is where importing data comes in handy.

There are numerous file types you can import to spreadsheets. 

These are: `.csv`, `.ods`, `.tab`, `.tsv`, `.txt`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xlt`, `.xltm` and `.xltx`.

We will show you how to upload these file types in the next few insights.
