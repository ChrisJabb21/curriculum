# Importing .ods files

---
## Content

A `.ods`, or an `OpenDocument Spreadsheet` file, is a spreadsheet file created by a Calc program in `OpenOffice`. `.ods` files are like excels and spreadsheet files, they store data in rows and columns.

Here is an example of a `.ods` file opened in a simple text editor.

`.ods` files are unreadable by humans when reading through a normal text editor.

We can import this file to a spreadsheet and then easily read that data.

To import an `.ods` file, go to `File` -> `Import`.

Next, a pop-up window will appear asking you to select a file.

There are 4 ways to import a file, we are going to choose the `Upload` option.

After your file has been uploaded, a new pop-up window will appear.

At the top you have your file name. 

Next, you have the `import location`. You have 3 options to chose from, we will choose the `Insert new sheet(s)` one.

When we press `Import Data` the above `.ods` file looks like this:
