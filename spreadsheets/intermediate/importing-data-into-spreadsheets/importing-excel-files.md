# Importing Excel files

---
## Content

`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xlt`, `.xltm` and `.xltx` are all Excel file types.

`.xls` is an older proprietary binary format used in older versions of **Excel**.

`.xlsx` is a newer Open XML format file used by newer versions of **Excel**. This is also the default file extension for **Excel**.

`.xlsm` is a `Macro-Enabled Worksheet` file. These file types can contain macros and scripts.

`.xlt` is a template file that uses the older proprietary binary format.

`.xltx` is a template file that uses the newer Open XML format used by newer versions of **Excel**. This is also the default template extension for **Excel**. These files are also `ZIP` files.

`.xltm` is a `Macro-Enabled Template` file. These file types can contain macros and scripts.

> All of these files have the same import option so we will show only 1.

To import an **Excel** file, go to `File` -> `Import`.

Next, a pop-up window will appear asking you to select a file.

There are 4 ways to import a file, we are going to choose the `Upload` option highlighted below.

After your file has been uploaded, a new pop-up window will appear.

At the top you have your file name. 

Next, you have the `import location`. You have 3 options to chose from, we will choose the `Create new spreadsheet` one.

After the file was uploaded you will get a message under the file name. If the import was successful you will also get a link to the new spreadsheet.
