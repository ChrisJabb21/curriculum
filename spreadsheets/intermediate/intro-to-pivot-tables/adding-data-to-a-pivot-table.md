# Adding rows and columns to a pivot table

---
## Content

We will use the same data set from the previous insight.

![data-set](https://img.enkipro.com/4df37873a027881b3da7956ba9453f0e.png)

In the `Pivot table editor`, we can choose one of the `Suggested` options. These suggestions analyze the data and give a few suggestions based on the data in your data set.

They can save time because they insert all the `Rows`, `Columns`, `Values` and `Filters` as soon as you select them.

If we wanted to manually customize our table we would have to add some rows and/or columns first.

To add rows and/or columns of data, press the `Add` button in the editor, and choose your data. `Rows` and `Columns` fields are used to display unique values from our source table.

**Because the data is unique, you cannot have the same data in the `Rows` and `Columns` fields. If we add the `Category` data in the `Rows` field it will not be available in the `Columns` field and vice versa.**

As soon as you add the data, you can view it on the left.

We have added the `Category` and `Product` row in ascending order.

**The order of the data in the `Rows` and `Columns` section is important.**

Pivot tables will group data based on the topmost data set in the editor.

You can switch the order of the data by dragging it.

## Practice

Creating a new pivot table ???

True or false?

The `Columns` field is used to categorize data in a pivot table. 

???

* will create an empty table.
* True
* False
* will create an already summarized table.
