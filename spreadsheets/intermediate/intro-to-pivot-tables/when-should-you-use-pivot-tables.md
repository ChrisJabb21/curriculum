# When should you use Pivot Tables

---
## Content

Pivot tables are best used when dealing with large data sets.

Having large data sets would take a long time to analyze without a pivot table.

You can use it to aggregate large data sets, summarize the data, and use it for presentation or comparisson.

On the other hand, having a pivot table for only a couple of rows of data is overkill. 

If the data set is very small, having a pivot table can be unnecessary since the data is easily summarized by hand or with a simple chart.

For a pivot table to work it has to be created from a row-column formatted data.

For instance, let's say we wanted to analyze this table:

The table is in the correct format and has a total of 4 columns and 287 rows.

Analyzing and extracting all of that data by hand would take a while. However, with the power of pivot tables we can add all of that data into the table and then calculate the sum of Sales for each category.

The summarized pivot table looks like this:
