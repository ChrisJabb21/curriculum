# What are Pivot Tables

---
## Content

A pivot table is a table used to summarize data from a selected database.

With pivot tables, you can analyze data from different perspectives.

They allow you to extract and analyze parts of, or all of the data from the table in just a few clicks.

You can sort, reorganize, and count data. You can get the totals, min, and max, averages, and perform other calculations without typing any formulas.

When creating a pivot table you do not have to worry about the original data. Anything done in the pivot table won't affect the original source data in any way. 

On the other hand, editing the source data of the pivot table will instantly update on the pivot table.

Pivot tables are also a good way of presenting data.
