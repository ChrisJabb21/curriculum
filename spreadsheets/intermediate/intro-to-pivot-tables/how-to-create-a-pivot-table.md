# How to create a Pivot Table

---
## Content

To create a pivot table, first you need to have some data.

Then you need to organize it in a row-column format.

We are going to use this data:

![data-set](https://img.enkipro.com/4df37873a027881b3da7956ba9453f0e.png)

If you want to practice with the same data set, you can find the download link in the `links` section.

After you have your data, either click on any cell in the data set and go to `Data` -> `Pivot table`.

Or manually select the table and go to `Data` -> `Pivot table`.

Next, a pop-up screen will appear where you can change the data range of the pivot table and choose if you want to insert it on the current sheet or a new one.

After you have added your pivot table, the table will be empty:

Clicking anywhere on the empty pivot table will open the `Pivot table editor` on the right side.

We will discuss the editors features in the next insight.
