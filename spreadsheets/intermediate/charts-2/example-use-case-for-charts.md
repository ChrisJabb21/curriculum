Charts are a great way of visualizing data.

Let's say we have a table spanning 3 years where there is an `Employee of the month` for each month of the 3 years.

![table](https://img.enkipro.com/1f584d886ee197028c667f42f509ef2c.png)

Since our table has only 36 entries it wouldn't be to hard to achieve our goal without a chart.

However, we can use a chart to visualize and see who was the `Employee of the month` the most out of the 3 years in just a few steps.

- select all the cells you want to include in your chart
- go to `insert - > chart`
- select the chart you want
- tick the `aggregate` button in the chart

Chart:

As you can see in the image above, it is much easier to visualize the data into a chart and then determine who has been the `Employee of the month` for most months. 

Also, when you hover over a part of the chart it will show the number of instances + the percentage.

## Practice

When should you use charts?

???

* When visualizing data is much easier than reading from a table.
* When the data you want to create a chart for has at least 100 entries.
