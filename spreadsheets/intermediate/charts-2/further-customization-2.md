We will modify the same chart from the previous insight with the last 4 `Customize` tabs.

The 4th tab is the `Legend` tab. Here you can add or remove the legend, select its position, font, size, format, and color.

We are going to add the Legend to the top of the chart, change its font to `Sans Serif` and add the `Bold` formatting.

Next we have the `Horizontal axis` tab. We can use this tab to modify the horizontal label, its size, font, format, and color. We can also make the chart treat labels as text, reverse the axis order, and select the Slant degree of labels.

We are just going to change the label formatting to `bold` in this tab.

Then we have the `Vertical axis` tab. Here we can also edit the label font, size, format, and color. We can also add a minimum and maximum value for our horizontal labels. By default the chart always includes all data but we can modify it to our needs.

Under the min and max we can allow bounds to hide data, change the scale factor, add a logarithmic scale, and change the number format.

In this tab we will also only change the label formatting to `bold`.

Last but not least is the `Gridlines` tab. This tab allows us to set the Major and Minor gridline count and color. We are not going to change anything in this tab.

Here are the differences between the uncustomized chart:
